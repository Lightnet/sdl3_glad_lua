# Status:
- prototype.

# Information:
  Prototype SDL 3.2, Glad 2.0, cimgui ??? and lua 5.4 build test to use all from lua script but couple will handle behind the scene for better management.

# Goals:
  To make lua script to run opengl 3d or 2d draw scene. As well editor by using the cimgui. To able not need to recompile build file.

  Network is later for simple.

  To keep it simple but easy to understand.

# Reason:
  To almost run off lua script to set up almost from c program libraries. Alhtought it will expose lua script since it open source to modified by other users.

  Another reason is that I work on vulkan which partly expose the api which required more work. With the help of the Grok AI. As I want to expose more in opengl to see how far it goes.  https://github.com/Lightnet/sdl3_vulkan_luajit  There are few people have done this before.
